# Workflow Engine

> **Status:** `core`
> **Removable in derived repos:** **no** — state machines are foundational
> **Source:** Extracted from isaac-adm `WorkflowService` / `WorkflowTransition` pattern

## Overview

The Workflow Engine provides a table-driven state machine for any entity that needs approval flows, status tracking, or compliance audit trails. Transitions are stored in `WorkflowTransitions` — no code changes needed to add new states or modify the flow.

## Usage (Procurement Example)

1. PurchaseOrder starts in `Draft` state
2. User clicks "Submit for Review" → transitions to `Submitted`
3. Manager clicks "Start Review" → transitions to `UnderReview`
4. Manager clicks "Approve" → transitions to `Approved`
5. User clicks "Mark as Completed" → transitions to `Completed`
