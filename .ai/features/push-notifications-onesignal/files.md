# Push Notifications (OneSignal) — File Map

## Owned files

### Backend

| Path | Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/backend/Libraries/Shared/Interfaces/IPushNotificationService.cs` | Interface | `SendToUsersAsync(externalUserIds, title, message, url?, data?)`, `SendToAllAsync(...)`, `SendToSegmentAsync(segment, ...)` |
| `src/backend/Libraries/Services/Services/OneSignalPushNotificationService.cs` | Service | OneSignal REST implementation. POSTs to `https://api.onesignal.com/notifications` with `Authorization: Key <RestApiKey>`. `IsConfigured()` short-circuits when `AppId` or `RestApiKey` is empty. Builds payload with `app_id`, `headings`, `contents`, optional `url` and `data` |
| `src/backend/Libraries/Shared/Models/OneSignalSettings.cs` | Options POCO | Two strings: `AppId`, `RestApiKey` |

### Frontend

| Path | Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/frontend/main/src/services/oneSignalService.ts` | Service | Lazy SDK loader: pushes config into `window.OneSignalDeferred`, injects `OneSignalSDK.page.js` script tag. Exposes `initOneSignal`, `setOneSignalExternalUserId`, `removeOneSignalExternalUserId`. All three are no-ops when `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` is not set |

## Touched files

| Path | What it contains | Why must be touched |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/backend/API/Program.cs` lines 105-106 | `builder.Services.Configure<OneSignalSettings>(configuration.GetSection("OneSignal"))` and `builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IPushNotificationService, OneSignalPushNotificationService>()` | DI wiring |
| `src/backend/API/appsettings.json` | `"OneSignal": { "AppId": "", "RestApiKey": "" }` | Empty in template, populated per environment |
| `src/frontend/main/src/main.ts` | `initOneSignal()` call on app boot | Required so the SDK loads (the call is a no-op when env var missing) |
| `src/frontend/main/src/composables/useAuth.ts` line 53 | `removeOneSignalExternalUserId()` inside `logout()` | Cleans the user/device mapping on logout |
| Login success handler (e.g. `LoginPage.vue` or post-redirect bootstrap) | `setOneSignalExternalUserId(userId)` after successful login | Links the OneSignal device record to the staff user id; required for `SendToUsersAsync` to find the recipient |
| `src/frontend/main/.env` | `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` and `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` (the latter selects `allowLocalhostAsSecureOrigin`) | Required to enable push in that environment |
| `public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` | The OneSignal service worker file | Must be served at site root for the SDK to register the worker. Place under `src/frontend/main/public/` so Vite copies it to the build output |

## Migrations

None — push state lives in OneSignal cloud, not in our DB.

## External dependencies

| Side | Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BE | (uses `HttpClient` only) | No package — pure REST |
| FE | (loads `OneSignalSDK.page.js` from CDN) | No npm dep — script is injected at runtime |

## Removal note

This feature is `optional-core`. A removal task should:

1. Delete `OneSignalPushNotificationService.cs`, `IPushNotificationService.cs`, `OneSignalSettings.cs`.
2. Delete `oneSignalService.ts`.
3. Remove the `OneSignal` section from `appsettings.json`.
4. Remove the `Configure<OneSignalSettings>` + `AddHttpClient<IPushNotificationService, ...>` lines from `Program.cs`.
5. Remove the `initOneSignal()` call from `main.ts`.
6. Remove the `removeOneSignalExternalUserId` call from `useAuth.ts` (line 53) — which currently imports from `oneSignalService.ts`.
7. Remove `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` from `.env` files.
8. Delete `public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js`.
