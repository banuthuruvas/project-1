# 05 — AIDLC Process (AI-Driven Software Development Life Cycle)

This is the canonical lightweight process all NIE-template projects follow.

```
Phase 1: INCEPTION ──→ Phase 2: CONSTRUCTION ──→ Phase 3: OPERATIONS
   (Specs & Context)      (Build Loop)              (Validate & Ship)
         ↑                      ↻                          │
         └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
                          Feedback Loop
```

| Phase | Focus | Goal | Primary artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Inception | Context & definition | Turn ideas into concrete specs | `requirements/`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/data-model.md`, `docs/security-model.md` |
| 2 — Construction | Build loop | Spec-driven, AI-assisted dev | `src/`, `tests/`, `.ai/features/<feature>/`, `.ai/adrs/` |
| 3 — Operations | Validate & maintain | CI/CD, audits, doc updates | `build/`, `tests/`, `.ai/tasks/` |

## Mandatory rules

| Rule | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Specification first | No code without reading the matching feature dossier or spec. |
| Steering enforcement | Every prompt to an AI agent includes the agent's tool-route file and the relevant feature dossier. |
| Memory persistence | Every architectural decision goes into `.ai/adrs/NNN-*.md`. |
| Spec compliance | When code conflicts with spec, fix the code or write an ADR superseding the spec. |
| No YAGNI | Don't implement unspecified features. |
| Enum-first state | Every status / state / type / category lives in an enum on BOTH backend and frontend. |

## Quality gates

| Gate | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Inception → Construction | Required spec docs exist for the feature being built |
| Per-feature completion | Tests pass, dossier exists, no enum strings, ADR for tradeoffs, docs updated |
| Construction → Deployment | CI green, security scan clean (`08-security-owasp-top10-2025.md`), version bumped |

## Decision log

When you make a non-trivial architectural decision: create `.ai/adrs/NNN-short-title.md` from `.ai/adrs/TEMPLATE.md`. Triggers:

- Choosing between technologies, libraries, or patterns
- Selecting a design pattern (CQRS vs CRUD, etc.)
- Adding a new external dependency
- Deviating from an existing spec
- Performance vs simplicity tradeoffs

## Documentation-as-code

| Format | Use cases |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown | Requirements, design specs, decisions, dossiers |
| Mermaid.js | Architecture (C4), ER diagrams, state machines |
| OpenAPI YAML | API contracts (when needed) |
| JSON Schema | Configuration validation |

**Forbidden for primary specs:** PNG, JPEG, PDF, Visio, Word. AI agents cannot parse them.
